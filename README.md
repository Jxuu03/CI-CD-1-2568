## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In recent years, ornamental fish keeping has gained significant popularity. However, maintaining a healthy and stable aquarium environment remains a challenge for many fish keepers. 
Tasks such as feeding and monitoring water quality parameters must be carried out regularly to ensure the fish's health and growth. 
Without proper management, poor water conditions can lead to fish stress, disease, or even mortality.

This project introduces a smart aquarium system that integrates IoT technology with a web application for remote monitoring and control. The system consists of two main components:

### 1. IoT Device
An ESP32-based microcontroller is used to collect real-time data from sensors that monitor:
- **Temperature**
- **pH Level**
- **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**
- **Water Level**

These sensors form the foundation of a **Water Quality Monitoring System**. The data is then transmitted via the internet to the web application.

### 2. Web Application
A responsive web app allows users to:
- View real-time water quality data
- Receive alerts when water quality is abnormal
- Remotely control certain actions within the aquarium (e.g., water refilling, drainage, feeding, and lighting)
